# Keylogger
This project demonstrates building a basic Python keylogger to capture keyboard inputs. It logs all keystrokes to a file, simulating how malicious actors might intercept sensitive data like passwords. The project is designed for educational purposes to help understand and defend against such threats.

# Prerequisites before using:
1. Python 3.x installed on your system
2. Pynput also installed on your system (to record keystrokes)

# Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository by typing in the following line into your terminal: "https://github.com/gavinpark123/keylogger-project.git"
2. And then this line: "cd keylogger-project"
3. (If pynput library already installed, skip this step) Type "pip install pynput" into your terminal

# Running the Program:
1. Type "python keylogger.py" into the terminal. This will start it!
2. Once it's running, start typing anything in your sentence (e.g. "Gavin Park is so good at basketball") and check the key_log.txt file for the text that you typed out
3. So cool isn't it???
